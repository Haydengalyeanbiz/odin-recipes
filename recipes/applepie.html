    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Apples: This recipe calls for eight small Granny Smith apples.</li>
        <li>Butter and flour: The filling starts with butter and all-purpose flour cooked into a paste.</li>
        <li>Sugars: A blend of white and brown sugar creates the perfect sweet flavor with a hint of warmth.</li>
        <li>Pie crust: Use a store-bought double crust pie pastry or make your own at home.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the filling: On the stove, make a paste with flour and butter. Add the sugar and water and bring to a boil. Simmer, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Assemble the pie: Press one crust into a pie plate. Place the sliced apples on the bottom crust. Use the top crust to make a lattice crust according to the recipe below. Pour the butter-sugar mixture over the lattice crust.</li>
        <li>Bake the pie: Bake the pie in a preheated oven until the apples are soft and the crust is golden brown. You'll bake the pie at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes, then you'll reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking for 35-45 minutes. All in all, the pie will bake for about one hour, give or take a few minutes. You'll know the pie is done when the apples are soft and the crust is a beautiful golden brown color.</li>
